### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Kai Jun, a Year 2 Nanyang Technological University (NTU) student, studying Renaissance Engineering Programme (REP), specialising in Computer Science.\
I am currently working as a Backend Software Engineer and Smart Contract Developer (Part-Time) in the blockchain space.
I am really passionate about Software Engineering, and how we can come up with endless solutions to solve the same problem makes it all the more interesting.
I am currently interested to explore into the FinTech, E-Comnmerce as a Software Engineer. But if the opportunity arises, I would also like to explore Data Analytics and Machine Learning.\
